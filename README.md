# Hey, I'm Nunya 👋  

I’m a data scientist with a background in **psychology** and a **Master’s in Data Science**.  
My work focuses on making data **equitable, human-centered, and actionable**.  

I’ve built ML pipelines, dashboards, and creative tools like Chrome extensions — always at the intersection of **technical depth** and **social impact**.
