#  Hi, I'm Chelyah ‚ú®
I started in psychology, studying how people think and behave while trying to provide the support and empathy I once needed. Now I‚Äôm a data scientist, chasing the same question with different tools: how do we use data to make life better? Sometimes that means privacy tools, sometimes health dashboards, sometimes machine learning pipelines; always with a focus on projects that matter.

üå± Lately I‚Äôm diving into Databricks, data lineage & governance, and the fun (and scary) world of generative AI security.

‚ö° Fun fact: My cat has been my most consistent project supervisor.
