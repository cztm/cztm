#  Hi, I'm Chelyah 👋
My path began in psychology, where I studied how people think and behave while offering the support I once looked for myself. Today I’m a data scientist, asking the same question in a new way: how can we use data to make life better? Whether through privacy tools, health dashboards, or machine learning pipelines, I focus on building projects that matter.

🌱 Lately I’m diving into Databricks, data lineage & governance, and the fun (and scary) world of generative AI security.

⚡ Fun fact: My cat has been my most consistent (and favorite) project supervisor.
